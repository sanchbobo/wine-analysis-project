# Wine Clustering with PCA

## Overview
This project applies machine learning clustering techniques, specifically using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering algorithms, to categorize different types of white wine based on their physicochemical properties. The goal is to identify patterns and group similar wines together, which can be useful for both understanding wine characteristics and for commercial categorization.

## Data
The dataset consists of various measurements of white wine characteristics such as acidity, sugar content, alcohol content, etc. The data is read from an Excel file named `Whitewine_v6.xlsx`.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need R and the following R packages:
- `readxl`
- `NbClust`
- `factoextra`
- `cluster`
- `ggplot2`
- `fpc`

## Files
- `Wine_Clustering.R`: The R script that handles data preprocessing, including outlier detection and data scaling.
- `Wine_PCA_Clustering.R`: The R script that performs PCA and clustering to categorize the wines.
- `Whitewine_v6.xlsx`: Excel file containing the physicochemical properties of wines.

## Setup and Execution
1. Ensure that R and all required libraries are installed.
2. Load the scripts in your R environment.
3. Execute `Wine_Clustering.R` first to preprocess the data.
4. Run `Wine_PCA_Clustering.R` to perform PCA and clustering.
5. Review the plots and clustering outputs generated by the scripts.

## Methodology
- **Outlier Detection**: Outliers are detected and removed using the IQR method to ensure a clean dataset for clustering.
- **Data Scaling**: Data is scaled to normalize feature scales before applying PCA.
- **PCA**: PCA is used to reduce the dataset's dimensionality and to identify the most significant features.
- **Clustering**: Several clustering algorithms are evaluated to find the optimal clustering solution.
